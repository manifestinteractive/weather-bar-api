# :warning: Weather Bar is Shutting Down :warning:

After several years of successful operation, I need to shut it down. The only contributions I have been receiving are folks asking for updates, but no one helping to make them, and the work has just piled to a point where I just can't do it on my own.

### Weather Bar will be Taken Offline March 1st, 2023**
